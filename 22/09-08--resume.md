my presenation really showed me the benefit that is kubernetes  
ive started to rig my house up for networking  
this past winter, i started sshing into my raspberry pi,  
i have since built my mom a computer, which ive been backing up to  
network and software engineering share so much commonality its amazing  
ive always had good linux skills,  
i started to host my own databased a few years back,  
setting up a VPN and routing traffic around my servers used to never interest me  
but ive started to feel like ive done everything else
