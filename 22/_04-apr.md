### rambles | 1938

just starting up

twerkin on publishing

> listening to [mj - beat it](https://youtu.be/WlTlUseVt7E)

### what is needed to publish | 1944

i guess imma just go top to bottom,
	extrapolate an order from that list

- header needs a rework
	- needs a back button
		gonna go back to wommy-www
			wommy-www needs a blog entry on da nav
	- this is where youre gonna choose categories
		probably enhance with JS
			tudo could probably fit in here

- the meta data block
	this whole thing needs alot of work 

### 2023 | probably need to rename to Rd

isnt it gonna be like a search type of thing for posts

### whats it gonna look like

- top left back to wom
- middle/right: categories
- meta can be later
- list
	- header
	- list items

> is tudo just a category? like marx
> is blog one of those too?
