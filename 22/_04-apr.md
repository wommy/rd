woke up n about by about 1530?

i reset mac so thats hes on LMDE
	i had lots of snags
	ventoy fucked
	im worried about roy front panel usbs

after long long time,
	i finally got it installed,
	i tried to update the nvidia drivers,
		forgot that the 750ti is the oldest of the normals,
		gotta dig into the 390s n 490s driver versions

it kinda sucks that they got rid of the tool,
	just surfed and found https://wiki.debian.org/NvidiaGraphicsDrivers
	that should do me right
