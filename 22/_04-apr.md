			tudo could probably fit in here

- the meta data block
	this whole thing needs alot of work 

### 2023 | probably need to rename to Rd

isnt it gonna be like a search type of thing for posts

### whats it gonna look like

- top left back to wom
- middle/right: categories
- meta can be later
- list
	- header
	- list items
