	thats why i had 

just spent hours fixing dotfiles

2105 , ? mermaidJS NAH
---
workflow stuff is so hard, i dunno why

> what is it

i already have so much data,
	first list what i have

	```mermaid
	bMARXlet --> sanity

	```

sanity needs a better Vue,
	something i never set up

marx , 2119
----

- `GET`

0536 , havent slept
---

what am i doin

i fucked with `sway` for a few hours

fuggin `wayland` has snags,
	ie `x` is just so cooked into everything

---

2117 , setting up json-server
---

i need to 
	create an interface
	add to list bookmarklet
	couple different categories

later
	share menu mobile

i guess a server needs to run
	express? probs fastify

fastify specifically, is probs too much
	i dont need to learn another thing 
	i need to create a form 

which is nice because i pretty much set up the environment

001 , tmux rambles 
---

why is tmux so hard

145 , so hard? ha! i got it all working
---

i have no clue what i did

pm2 is such a hog

i do so much so often

> i just need to annotate it better

154 , brainstorming ON how to best log
---

thats what this whole thing is,
	a log

`this` is an entry on a log

all it needs is some BS `npx script`

> what is it named?

> what does it do?
> 	takes user input
> 	curls to an endpoint
> 		that means i need to set up an endpoint



```js 

```


it feels so nice to not be worried about constantly losing data , 0437
---

612 , think i got the nodecli fetch down
---

701 , thoughts
---
this should be the command
	`rd`

adds a new entry, `datetime`

but what i was really on

`rd`: a cli for GETs and POSTs
	it needs to be more cli
	maybe i could write straight json
	PUT will come down the line

	its like a weird logger
	it could be a tui

i guess i could ping my `yt-history`
