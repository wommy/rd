#### 2152 | all this stuff needs to be automated

i need to create tooling around all of this

that doesnt seem very fun



none of this seems very fun, i need to get a better understanding of how to automate this

fuck github copilot sometimes


first thing i need to do is publish the blog

that means digging into Wommy

---

i cant believe i wrote all those bash scripts,

why didnt i just use node,

porting this is probably going to be its own thing

---

guess im digging into wommy


#### 2222 | ok so i got wommy pulled up

fuggin yarn is such a pain

i think i mostly got the wommy dir structure up

still gotta find that NAV component

#### 2229 | pushed rd bc i got scared
