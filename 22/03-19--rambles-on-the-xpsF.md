i need to automate Rd so bad

i need to cleanup my dotfiles
i need to cleanup my aliases
i need to do so much

- [x] cleaned up the xpsF hostname issue | 2249
  - https://fedoramagazine.org/set-hostname-fedora/

i should probably be using i3 > sway huh

## 2312

- [x] cleaned up i3 borders

i think i need to do xset next
and clean up autostart

so i got two main files im editing

- .profile
- .xprofile

all the x commands should be in x profile, 
which should just be in the header of i3

so lets do that

- [x] xset r rate 300 50 | 2354
  - https://askubuntu.com/questions/765738/how-can-i-increase-the-speed-of-the-cursor-in-gnome-terminal
  - i needed to install xset

and i needed to put them in the top of i3,
i think i need to make .xprofile executable
