## Details

### Cover Letter

im going to come out and say it:  
my past work history is pretty strange

my fathers sudden death between finish college and graduation  
really put a damper on my post-degree job search.  
i took it as well as one could, but my mother and my sister did not,  
faciliting a sudden moving back home a few months later.  
it really was a PTSD nightmare.  
I got my legs about me back in detroit  

i met another girl who got sucked from chicago under similar blunt trauma  
we dated long distance for years, and i did odd-jobs, like caregiving  
for my demeted grandfather, while honing my design and development skills  
for meager clients. i made great use of new york networking  

i always leaned towards static generation.  
everyone always told me i was foolish for choosing that architecture  
it took nyc to find like minded people, who proved it viability  
some of the largest comporations that exist

in retrospect, the long distance relationship wasnt the most stable  
i never knew if i should plant roots in detroit, or bind for NYC  
i finally saved up the money and got the job when the whole thing fell apart

i got a handful of new clients before the impending COVID  
which brought out my mothers own dementia

i panic moved to chicago, which only lasted three months,  
i have since been back at home doing the client / consulting thing



### currently employed?

yes and no, ive been freelancing / consulting for years now,  
im kind of sick of it to be honest,  
the pay is very come and go, im over chasing down clients,  
i ususally put in 50/60 hour weeks because there is no real clocking out  
i just want to clock in and help untangle the dragon  
i miss having a team  
benefis would be super nice

### when able to start?

next week,  
tho i would love to visit the office, im planning on attending jamstackconf in november,  
and wouldnt mind swinging out before then to shake come hands

### exp with css html js jquery?

i first encountered css3 html5 javascript and jquery in 2010.  
an early memory was a site called https://youmightnotneedjquery.com  
css - i wrote the init commit for https://preset-env.cssdb.org/,  
another designer i really enjoy following is Andy Bell, https://piccalil.li/

when i build sites, i use this static site generator called Eleventy https://11ty.dev  
it supports 11 templating languages, i use one called nunjucks which is a node port of a jinja, which uses a syntax that looks alot like twig  
i used to write alot of pug, previously jade, when i was back and forth between new york 5 years ago,

as for real css opinions, i like utility frameworks, like tailwind  
previously mentioned Andy Bell has a CUBE methodology, composition utility block exception 



### experience with sql?

3 - i did some in college, havent touched it in a few years, but i could roll up the sleeves if need be,  
if you asked about json i could say 5, ditto with yaml  
ive been working more with mongo, graphql type stuff for the last few years,  
im not the best with graphql, probably 3 there too  
i feel that with schema, you kind of just write them, once and then use them for a while, and then you do it again months later  
i really prefer RPC type logic, TRPC is a project that interests me

i really want to get more into SQL tho, between maria, sqlite, and postgres  
i feel really stable in supporting these use cases

ive seen some very nice things done with prismadb, a javascript orm
