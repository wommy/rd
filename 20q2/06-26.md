### 1213 - from last rd

	seamus

	on 10/15/19 i devised a bill of $350:

		$  75	removed # from url
		$ 200	angular, AWS research; required by above 
		$  75	updated SSL certificate


	dates	|  work summary
	-----	|  ----------
	04/29	|  created a donate page, uploaded it, established a redirect
	05/17	|  AWS research, found cloudfront blocking the redirect
	05/31	|  route53 redirect working, cloudfront still blocking url	
	06/03	|  researched, implemented an override, http 301; didnt work
	06/25	|  researched a solution to remove the angular hash route
	07/26	|  researched, learned, installed dependencies, and tested codecommit
	10/01	|  implemented angular solution through codecommit and cloudfront
	10/07	|  updated ssl certificate	

			      removed # from url   |    $  75
			   angular, AWS research   |    $ 200
			 updated SSL certificate   |    $  75
				      ----------   |	-----
					subtotal   |    $ 350
				   received 12/7   |  - $ 175
				      ----------   |	-----
				     outstanding   |    $ 175

	

	a ballpark number i thought fair due to the amount of time i invested
		was trying to avoid renavigating the labrynth that is our communication

	on 11/26 i requested this from you
	on 12/7 you paid $175
	
	i have since gone back over our communications from this period
	to create a proper invoice, something i hoped i wouldnt have to do
	
	04/29	|  created a donate page, uploaded it, established a redirect
		   * a solution that would have worked if not for Geoff's setup
	05/17	|  AWS research, found cloudfront blocking the redirect
	05/31	|  route53 redirect working, cloudfront still blocking url
	06/03	|  researched, implemented an override, http 301; didnt work
	06/25	|  researched a solution to remove the angular hash route
	07/26	|  researched, learned, installed dependencies, and tested codecommit
	10/01	|  implemented angular solution through codecommit and cloudfront
	10/07	|  updated ssl certificate

	i spent at least 6 days over 5 months getting to the bottom of this issue
		at least 3 additional days were spent that im lacking documentation for

	at the time my reduced daily rate was $50, totalling at least $300

	for perspective, still short of the $500 minimum consultant quote

	i am requesting the remaining $175
