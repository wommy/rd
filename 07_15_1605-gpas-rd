omg that was so hard to open this time

basic TODOLIST
- [?] how todolist works off of rd
- [?] markdown = base
- [?] vimwiki

i dunno what to write

i need to come up with a todolist

i need to come up with requirements
	uploads to github
	? .md
	
why am i doing this?

i need to update technomad.media
	olde.technomad.media
	? new
		list of blogposts
		? jekyll spin off
		? gatsby

TODO
- [ ] SEAMUS
- [ ] technomad.media

== 16:38 - WTF
i cant believe that /technomad_media-www is the same as /technomad_bash
i need to create some type of script system that creates my website
and then i need to do some gatsby shit on that to produce the website

first step is getting the bash commands down

V says i should start learning python

technomad_bash was create Mar10
technomad_media-www was created Jun27

same file folder structure

== 1701 

folder file structure

/posts
/pages
.template
index.script
build.script
zip.script

you got a zip script:
  zips the template onto the files
you got the index script
  that creates the index from the posts
		adds it to /pages
you got the build script
  it has to build the site:
		has to build a nav somewhow
			add that to the template
	  builds index
  	walks every file, zipping on the template

== 1818

i gotta have a way to upgrade a blogpost
