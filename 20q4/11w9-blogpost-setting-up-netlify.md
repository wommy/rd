#### rambles

so in this blogpost im going to explain how i get my content to display at a www

i originally required in two submodules and i called myself crazy

then i required in just the content, that was definitely the wrong move

then i required in just the technomad-stack, and that was wrong too

so i think requiring in both is actually right

which is crazy to think about: over a year tweaking my workflow only to come back to the original

ok enough rambles, now to build

#### what to do

so i logged into netlify

this might be a problem because i cant mess up my mx mail records

this might be a super pain

#### report: found a bunch of shit

ok so good news:  
i didnt actually delete that technomad_blog repo

medium news:  
technomad_blogposts is not going to work
i need to publish from rd

	this will save me so much time its non negotiable 

<!-- maybe i  -->

- [ ] publish olde technomad_blog
- [ ] push some commits, prune some branches

sounds great
