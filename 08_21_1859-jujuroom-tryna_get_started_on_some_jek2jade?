after my nueue.md i stopped working on technomad and picked up freedomtoons
i need some kind of cross_folder/system_wide todo list

i was looking into vim for something like this v recently

technically it should live in this folder

i need to look over my old olde2nueue posts
i need to show display these differently and encapsulate the project

read this ://24ways.org/2018/turn-jekyll-up-to-eleventy/	-	dunno how to feel
	part of me wants to upgrade because it should be easier to do some things
	yet i do need to spend time porting it over
		it should just be a theme, minima ://github.com/jekyll/minima
		first thing i notice is that i dont use all the features, let alone half
		all i need out the gate is templating, includes, post_list from folder

	it seems that i need a jek211ty_theme
