		seamus

		i devised a bill of $350 on 10/15, breakdown found above
		i requested this from you on 11/26
		you paid $175 on 12/07

		we talked about a price of $75 for features 
			the first of which was removing # from url
			the other was updating the SSL certificate

		removing the # from the url ending up being needlessly difficult
			the work from 4/29 should have achieved this,
			especially with minimal help from geoff
		but due to geoff's technology stack and lack of help navigating it
			it took at least a half a dozen days over months
			instead of a day or two in a week
		due to this, i decided to charged an additional flat fee of $200
			far less than the $500 minimum consultant quote i received
		going back over the dates and time worked, 
			this should have been at least $300

		i am requesting the remaining $175

### 1256 - invoice 2

	seamus

	my rates have changed in an attempt to streamline billing
		my new day rate is $80 for 5-6 hours
		a half day is $40 for 2-3 hours
		a long day is $120 for 8+ hours

	my template has also changed
		work is separated in into blocks
		each with a work summary and a subtotal
		grand total at the bottom

	in the future most invoices will probably omly have one block,
		this is just due to the magnitude of work in this billing cycle
	


	unless specified, all dates are 2020
