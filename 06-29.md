	seamus

	i devised a bill of $350 on 10/15, breakdown found above
	i requested this from you on 11/26
	you paid $175 on 12/07

	we talked about a price of $75 for features 
		the first of which was removing # from url
		the other was updating the SSL certificate

	removing the # from the url ending up being needlessly difficult
		the work from 4/29 should have achieved this,
		especially with minimal help from geoff
	but due to geoff's technology stack and lack of help navigating it
		it took at least a half a dozen days over months
		instead of a day or two in a week
	due to this, i decided to charged an additional flat fee of $200
		far less than the $500 minimum consultant quote i received
	going back over the dates and time worked, 
		this should have been at least $300

	i am requesting the remaining $175
