		seamus

		i devised a bill of $350 on 10/15, breakdown found above
		i requested this from you on 11/26
		you paid $175 on 12/07

		we talked about a price of $75 for features 
			the first of which was removing # from url
			the other was updating the SSL certificate

		removing the # from the url ending up being needlessly difficult
			the work from 4/29 should have achieved this,
			especially with minimal help from geoff
		but due to geoff's technology stack and lack of help navigating it
			it took at least a half a dozen days over months
			instead of a day or two in a week
		due to this, i decided to charged an additional flat fee of $200
			far less than the $500 minimum consultant quote i received
		going back over the dates and time worked, 
			this should have been at least $300

		i am requesting the remaining $175

### 1256 - invoice 2

	seamus

	my rates have changed in an attempt to streamline billing
		my new day rate is $80 for 5-6 hours
		a half day is $40 for 2-3 hours
		a long day is $120 for 8+ hours

	my template has also changed
		work is separated in into blocks
		each with a work summary and a subtotal
		grand total at the bottom

	in the future most invoices will probably omly have one block,
		this is just due to the magnitude of work in this billing cycle
	


	unless specified, all dates are 2020

   19/	07/30	build freedom toons in jekyll initial build		$  80
   19/	12/11	moved from jekyll to 11ty, due to easier use		$  80
	 1/16	finalizaled transition from jekyll to 11ty,		$  80
			crossed i's dotted t's, other misc changes
	 1/29	youtube api						$  80

    summary:								total:  $ 320
when communcations with geoff started to get bad, 
instead of wasting my time, i put it to good use and rebuilt
freedomtoons in the software i was using at the time jekyll

a few months later when i picked this project back up,
i was using different software, 11ty.
i rebuild freedomtoons in 11ty, and then spent another day
making sure that i didnt lose any of jekyll's functionality

the next thing i needed to do was get the youtube API working, 
but that was giving me problems, do i created a dummy file
with ten or so of the most recent posts

i finally got the youtube api working 


-
	 2/11	footer email form; theme tweaks				$  80
	 2/20	donate page; theme tweaks				$  80

    summary:								total:  $ 160
at this point, i had a 80% copy of the existing freedomtoons site

the next thing tasks i decided to tackle were the newsletter and the donate page

to accept emails, you need a form. for another client,
i included the form in the footer, so i applied similar logic here

for the donate page, i decided to copy a well-known one, tim pools


-
	 2/28	edit geoff code 					$ 120
	 2/29	discover and disable youtube api secret keys 		$  80

    summary:								total:  $ 200
on February 28th, you contacted me to discuss dissolving our relationship
you expressed disapproval with the direction of my previous code
you gave me a screenshot of how you wanted the site to work
i spent the day on it and got it looking exactly how you wanted it

the next day, i was looking over optimizations and found a huge security hole
your youtube api secret key was publicly accessable
i spent the rest of the day doing my best to secure that


-
	 3/2-3	removed footer, donate page code; kept theme upgrades 	$ 160
	 3/4	brought geoff's code updates into my system		$  80

    summary:								total:  $ 240
realizing that amount of work required to resolve the security issue
i decided my time would be better spent updating the 11ty variant of freedomtoons

i spent the next two days undoing all the code i previously did in february
keeping only the code that updated the look and feel of theme
and stashing the footer form and donate page code on a branch for later

i finalized this segment by copying the edits i did to geoff's code
into 11ty, to bring 11ty up to speed with the image you gave me days previous
	

-
	 3/5	upgraded header, sidebar images;
	 	created custom responsive header			$ 120
	 3/6	favicon: walked thru creation; uploaded 		$  40
	 3/14	added fontawesome, a social media image library		$  40
	 3/16	added handwriting font; misc theme edits		$  40
	 4/28	added adsense, moved DNS from godaddy to netlify 	$  40

    summary:								total:  $ 280
this final block mostly describes a multitude of smaller changes

there was a loading issue due to the size of the images in the header and sidebar
after you descreased their size and sent me copies, i substituted them

there was a bug in the headers alignment at certain viewport sizes,
after researching a solution, i created a hacky solution to resolve it

i walked you through how to create a favicon and then uploaded those files
i added fontawesome, a css framework that provides social media icons
i uploaded the font you provided me with, and performed misc edits to get it to work

finally we walkthrough how to add adsense to the site, which ultimately didnt work
and changed the DNS provider from GoDaddy to netlify

### 2109 - perhaps final?


	seamus

	i changed my rates in an attempt to streamline billing
	i now have three different price points, 1x 2x and 3x
		2x is normal day rate, ~5 or 6 hours
		1x is a half day, 2-3 hours
		3x is a long day, 8+ hours
	i kept it at $75/day, but going forward it'll be $80 for easy divisibility


  date	  rate	description	unless specified, all dates are 2020
	
07/30/19   2x	when communcations with geoff started to get bad, 
		instead of wasting my time, i put it to good use and rebuilt

		making sure that i didnt lose any of jekyll's functionality

01/16	   2x	the last thing needed to get freedomtons working, the youtube API,
		was giving me problems. i created a file with dummy freedomtoons contents
		so that i could update the theme's fidelity

01/29	   2x	finally got the api working 

02/11	   2x	at this point, my version of freedomtoons was an 80% copy
02/20	   2x	two tasks on the agenda were the newsletter and the donate page

02/29	   2x	optimizationing the previous day's code, i stumbled upon a huge security hole
		your youtube api secret key was publicly accessable
		i spent the rest of the day doing my best to secure that

03/02	   2x	realizing that amount of work required to resolve the security issue

03/04	   2x	copied the update to geoff's code to 11ty; alot harder than it sounds

03/05	   3x	improved site loading time by replacing images with smaller variants
		the header had a bug at certain viewport sizes; hacky solution

03/16	   1x	uploaded your 'handwriting' font; misc theme edits for consistency
04/28	   1x	added adsense; changed the DNS provider from GoDaddy to netlify


    grandtotal:  30[total rate] /2[half days to full days] *$75[the day rate] = $1125
