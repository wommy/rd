hey guys,

so i know i havent posted in a while, but alot has and is happening  
but ill get to that later, for right now, 

im trying to detail bumping \_posts into its own repo, via submodules  

the link i followed that got me to where i am now is https://help.github.com/en/articles/splitting-a-subfolder-out-into-a-new-repository

things i need todo:  
_	require the submodule back into technomad\_jekyll

so how do i do this

i gotta split the folder out   
then require the submodule in such a way that i can auto build it?

the true test of this working will be if i can trigger two different builds with the same content\_submodule

i dunno if i even want to do this now, but here goes nothing
