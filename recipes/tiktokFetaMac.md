## notes

turned out better than last time,
	but i dunno if im gonna pressure cook it again
	i would still do in instapot, but on saute

i would do aeromatics first:
	oil
	spices: crushed red, cayenne, aleppo, 1/2 garlic
	1/2 onion

then [risottata](https://www.lacucinaitaliana.com/italian-food/hacks/pasta-risottata-an-alternative-cooking-method) the noodles
	that would let me watch the water level better

i would like to add a fiber next time
	like a brussel sprout, or brocolli

finally finish with the tomatoes

i forgot the basil again so i substitued two dollops of pesto
	it was nice
	might buy a tub to keep around

i did like the olives last time

anyway im rambling
