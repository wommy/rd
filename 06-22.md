summary
	seamus contracted me mid april 2019 to do a slurry of changes.
	this invoice bills
		removing the # from the url
		updating the ssl
		and the work that made that possible

all dates are in year 2019

work: 
	dates - summary
	4/29 
		created a donate page, uploaded it, established a redirect
	5/17
		dug into AWS, found that cloudfront was blocking the redirect
	5/31
		got a redirect to work with route53, AWS's routing service
		cloudfront still blocking proper url from working
	6/3
		researched and implemented http 301 in an override attempt, doesnt work
	6/25
		researched and found the proper angular code to remove the hash route
	7/26
		researched, learned, installed dependencies, and tested codecommit
	10/1
		implemented angular solution through codecommit and cloudfront
	10/7
		updated ssl certificate
	
we dicussed $75 per feature,
on my stack, i could have implemented a soltuion, 4/29's work, in one day
from beginning to end, just shy of 6 months transpired
i did my best to go back over communication from that period
	to create some type of timeline as to the time i spent and the changes i made
the above dates and times only reflect a loose generalization of work done
	i left out at least three other dates which i dont have documentation on

i surmised a bill of $350 on 10/15 detailing:
	$75 per feature
		removed # from url
		update ssl certificate
	$200 
		navigating AWS technologies: 
			s3, cloudfront, route53, codecommit, probably more i forgot
		and their intersection with angular

i did this from the hip, trying to avoid tracking down specific dates/times
looking back i spent AT LEAST six (6) days troubleshooting
with slim to nil help from the past dev who set things up
in hindsight this should be a minimum of $300 dollars, 
	but probably closer to $500, the price a consultant quoted

i billed seamus $350 on 11/26, he paid $175 on 12/7

all im asking is for this invoice's withstanding $175
with the pledge to provide better documentation in the future

### 1243 - rewrite


## summary

seamus contacted me mid april 2019 to perform a series of upgrades on his site

supported by the previous developer, Geoff

we discussed an a la carte billing of $75 per feature
	due to the amorphous requirements of each improvement

the first feature attempt was cleaning angulars hash routing from the url
	on my stack, a solution i could have implemented in one day - see `04/29`
	i did not forsee the spending the next six months navigating AWS' quirks 


## timeline, compended from communications from 2019: April - December

at least three dates omitted due to lack of documentation

| dates | work summary                                                           |

## conclusion; billable

on 10/15 i surmised a bill of $350 detailing:

$75 per feature:
	- removed # from url
	- update ssl certificate

$200:
	- navigating angular and AWS: s3, cloudfront, route53, codecommit, et all

i did this from the hip, trying to avoid tracking down specific dates/times

looking back i spent AT LEAST six (6) days troubleshooting

in hindsight this should be a minimum of $300 dollars, 
	but probably closer to $500, the quoted consultant's price

i billed seamus $350 on 11/26, he paid $175 on 12/7

im asking for this invoice's withstanding $175
with the pledge to provide better documentation in the future

seamus

	on 10/15/19 i devised a bill of $350:
		$	75	|	removed # from url
		$	200	|	research into angular and AWS required by the above 
		$	75	|	updated SSL certificate

	a ballpark number i thought fair due to the amount of time i invested
		was trying to avoid renavigating the labrynth that is our communication

	on 11/26 i requested this from you
	on 12/7 you paid $175
	
	i have since gone back over our communications from this period
	to create a proper invoice, something i hoped i wouldnt have to do
	
	04/29	|	created a donate page, uploaded it, established a redirect
			* a solution that would have worked if not for Geoff's setup
	05/17	|	AWS research, found cloudfront blocking the redirect
	05/31	|	route53 redirect working, cloudfront still blocking url
	06/03	|	researched, implemented an override, http 301; didnt work
	06/25	|	researched a solution to remove the angular hash route
	07/26	|	researched, learned, installed dependencies, and tested codecommit
	10/01	|	implemented angular solution through codecommit and cloudfront
	10/07	|	updated ssl certificate

	i spent at least 6 days over 5 months getting to the bottom of this issue
		at least 3 additional days were spent that im lacking documentation for

	at the time my reduced daily rate was $50, totalling at least $300

	for perspective, still short of the, at least $500, consultation quote

	i am requesting the remaining $175
