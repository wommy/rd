_	master - beta- dev 4 wommy & technomad

i gotta create a master todolist

all this shit is already all over the place

i emailed netlify so waiting on that

so i need a wommy blog and the technomad blog

so i need a build system that not only builds the website,
but also spins up a blog, resume, css, docs
jekyll has that built in subfolder command
thats proobably the move, before transition to 11ty

so here i need to open a new md in technomad folder
by first creating it
	i need to pull in from technomad, but only posts
