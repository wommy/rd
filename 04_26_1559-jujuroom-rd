yeah so

im trying to put all my folders into a mono repo

im thinking of organizing them by date

i should probably write a lil sumthin about each

im mostly just concerned about putting the data on github
or rather it never actually making it there

i think i should make this an actual blog post

how would i do that?

https://thoughtbot.com/blog/a-tmux-crash-course

i should build tmux in vim fsfs

toggle file manager <?- nerdtree

_ make experiements
  _ add [feed, grid]
