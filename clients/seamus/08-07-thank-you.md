hey seamus

i wanted to thank you for the money
and i wanted to apologize for my own disorganization with the billing



a $500 bill is huge for me
usually like 200-400
so i wanted to apologize for slapping you with that
there was a $300 pay period that covered dec and jan
i did two edits in february and those are the ones you didnt like
i still think you really need a narrative and i think a singple page would be good for that


### yo seamus!

thanks for the money!

im sorry the bill took so long, it was super hard to go back over that length of time and create the bill historically

i take full responsiblity and am sorry, yet grateful because it led me to overhaul my billing process

i usually only do 2/3 things in a billing cycle, and usually payment things are agreed upon in the beginning

im going to try to bring that model here too.


once again, i must apologise, my bills rarely exceed $500, and i usually hate billing for even that high. i could have, and should have billed you in separate sections.

also id like to talk about what each pay period would be like - for exmplae: i feel like i owe you 3/4 things, each probably like 1/2 day jobs
im going to charge you half rate for them for putting up with all this

after that, i would like to set you up with a basic CMS, some thing that will allow you to change the site from your end 
- im currently working on this with another client, so after i work out the bugs, ill install it on your site too, maybe also for 1/2 rate
- i think itll add alot of agency to your side of our relationship, 

one thing itll allow you to do is create blogposts; 
it would also allow you to edit pages on the site selectively
- at the beginning i would have to walk thru some thing, but i think its the right direction to go down
- i feel like the current work ive done on the site is very hard to display, its been more in configuration, and from your shoes, everything still looks the same

	this sucks, i feel real bad about it too, but its almost done and because we took all this time, the next steps will be more incremental and visible

	and if it doesnt work out, all the code will be super easy to move / transition to someone else, unlike geoff's, i gaurentee it

	thanks for sticking with me this long
	- im working on this other clients piece, after that ill reach back out, a week or two
	lastly, if the blog features works out to your liking, it would be the same process, though more complicated, to add a store to your website 
	maybe you could sell some merch: tshirts, buttons, stickers, hats
	- and if that works out maybe i could set up some type of subscription service, or at least be able to middle man you with someone who could

	in the next few days ill reach back out with the last few things i wand to tidy up, pretty much come up with an estimate

	thanks again so much seamus
