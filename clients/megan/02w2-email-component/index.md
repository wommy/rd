jegs, wassup

heres what im gonna do

first keyterm Component , this is just a thing we build
	components can be nested inside of other components , but thats later

so for the first component, actually were gonna do a nested pair

so you have a List, and a List_Item
	the List is the constructor/factory of the List_Item
	Lists output List_Items based on an input
