hey anna!Â 
how are you?

so im about to do a stack upgrade,  

the stack is the 5 things i glue together to make everything work

so because of this im going back over and learning a new thing in order to better deliver services
im doing server maintance and improving on what needs it

anyway, im learning a new framework called react, which is made by facebook

it creates the view layer, or what the computer shows you when you visit a website

anyway im going to be doing a facelift, and because of that i thought id reach out

im fixing how you input data from your end
ie what we were working on before

im creating this new system component thing for another client, which is cool and all, but - ill have to show you, im trying to document it a lil - but its along the lines of how your website was before with the modal: [click the Open Modal button](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp)

but yeah im documenting the upgrade, and when it happens, youll probably something like a chain email from me,
a service im hoping to be able to pass on to you
