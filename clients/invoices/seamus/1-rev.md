		i devised a bill of $350 on 10/15, breakdown found above
		i requested this from you on 11/26
		you paid $175 on 12/07

		we talked about a price of $75 for features 
			the first of which was removing # from url
			the other was updating the SSL certificate

		removing the # from the url ending up being needlessly difficult
			the work from 4/29 should have achieved this,
			especially with minimal help from geoff
		but due to geoff's technology stack and lack of help navigating it
			it took at least a half a dozen days over months
			instead of a day or two in a week
		due to this, i decided to charged an additional flat fee of $200
			far less than the $500 minimum consultant quote i received
		going back over the dates and time worked, 
			this should have been at least $300

		i am requesting the remaining $175
