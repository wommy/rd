whats this about - i dunno

i think im trying to move from fuggin sublime to vim
i wrote a bash command

import rd.sh

this is nuts - i dont know where to go from here

so what do i want to do

i want to create a ssg

i realized today that a ssg isnt that different from a server
i want to take a website and cut it up with command line?
i dunno about that

i enjoy using linux, so much so

i want to hook up earl with mx_linux

i want to create a monorepo

i dont get why im using EJS

i just want to include things

id rather use linux to cut something together than nodejs

i can even use python

i think i just want to configure a server

what would this server do

it would take numerous files and sew them together

for every file in this folder
	do this

point to the folder: /pages
for each
	run build_page

i want to write a function

whats this function gonna do
	
read a folder

from that folder its going to make a map, a list

[index, ]

RUN PROGRAM

i cant believe i wrote the rd.sh

so 

what my program gonna do

execute here

build.sh
	look for _template.html
	get [array] of pages
	for each
		template(#variables_from:$config.js)
		config.js
			populated from pages/

i need to
	run a script that populates config.js from pages/
