# blogpost on setting up chromebook

so i went thru the chromebook,  
pushed all the repos

now i gotta powerwash it?

### 1638 , nasty call with drew

i booted into recovery mode,  
and reset by usb chrome image  
then i enabled developer mode with ESC REFRESH and POWER,  
same way i got into recovery mode

downloaded the script, ran it, need to remove the screw now

### 1902 , just got back from being chewed out by drew

chromebook backup went off with minor hitches,  
i didnt know i needed a second usb for the backup,  
i dont know if i formatted it correctly, maybe skipped a step,  
first reboot was rough, first few cycles didnt make sense,  
after i plugged in the backup a different grub came up,  
i swapped the manjaro and it took.

now im upgrading the new computer
