so geoff

can you please explain your AWS workflow?

im having trouble translating it to my github model

my workflow is as follows:

i clone the repo locally, make a feature branch, edit it until it works and looks nice,
merge it into the development branch, push it to the remote, and check it on the server,
when that looks all fine and dandy i push it to the master

i am not comfortable with AWS, and i think thats giving me my headache
i would first like to ask some questions about s3 buckets
	i dont even know what that is technically, im assuming its just like a github repo?

do you just ssh into your S3 bucket? i need to edit the angular config file
	do i just ssh in?

=== 1614 - so i got aws codecommit setup, dont ask me how

ok so geoff-

	i set up my ssh keys so i downloaded the repo locally

=== 1920 - copying into s3 bucket; netlify works

=== 2316 - i fuckin did it
