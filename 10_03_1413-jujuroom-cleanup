gotta do resume

ok so what do i need to do

i should require out my data

=== 1622 - whats fuckin next
_ create a template
_ fix data up more

=== 1654 - did a good resume writeup on paper, section headers

=== 1820 - just read a bunch, check bookmarks
	mostly about handlebars and liquid and jekyll

i need to think about my template and my data

should i rewrite my old one because its already done?

i think i can write a function for mailto links ://css-tricks.com/snippets/html/mailto-links/
	<a href="mailto:"+{title}
			+subject ? '+"?subject={subject}' : ""
	>{title}</a>

=== 1841 - versioning template & data

=== 2027 - lots of vim and organizing? i dunno seems like a wide gap
	about to go to isaacs @ufo

=== 2226 - at ufo - what am i doing

i think i need to split out the things?

data
	contact
		
	experience
		work
		skills
		events, conferences, meetups

=== 2256 - i dunno what i need to do
i think this new version is about the split between data and template
	i already have a rough template
		need to clean it up
	need to clean up data 2

	i think why skills is bogus, i need to save that bish somewhere tho

	bump out folders
