yup, still working on this
i dont need to do TMJ-content, but that feels like its about right

i previously worked on updating jekyll, that wasnt too bad
i also booped content into its informal directories, that could use some more,
tho i think i should do it in repo

i feel like i need to redo olde and nueue

meh

  i dont think going back and editing the past is that good
  i think i should just move forward with new information
