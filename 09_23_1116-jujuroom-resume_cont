gonna check the previous rd - just understanding oneflow shit
	i think the only difference was between the -ff of the merge, 
	git flow advocates a --ff-only, whereas oneflow advocates a rebase and a --no-ff merge
		yet oneflow advocates --ff-only merges for releases and hotfixes
i dunno how i got stuck on that for so long
