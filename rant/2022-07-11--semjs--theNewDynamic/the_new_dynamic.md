## description

2022 is alot different from 2017, 
yet we seem to hover around similar problems:
SSG vs SPA vs SSR, client vs server, 
when to render, when to fetch, hydration, and state

i feel like everything used to be so black and white:
i was a front-end dev, firmly on team SSG;
but today, everything is so gray:
caching, redirects / proxies, image optimization, 
headless CMSs, CDNs, APIs, serverless functions

but new is exciting:
how does vite / remix influence the next rewrite?
does the edge remind anyone else of service workers?
tailwind, and PWAs, and monorepos, oh my!

theres alot to cover, welcome to the new dynamic
