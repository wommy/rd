  - primeagen & ryan carniato
    - server - stateless
      *mvc makes sense*
      - hook model data up to view data
      - managed by
      - singleton controller
    - client - long sessions
      - mvc -> mvvm 
      - controller isnt singleton
        *per instance*
      - ?
        *what should you tie state data to*
      - view-model
        *doesnt need to be sent to server*
    - state belongs with view
      - dont wrap models with view-models
      - view + model = component
  - eleventy w12
    *- Sun, Jun 5, 2022 at 8:43pm*

      *eleventy client components*
      - how/when load client-side components
