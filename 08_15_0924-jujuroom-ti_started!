talking anr on feeld? what is life

=== 1031
gotta 11ty freedomtoons_jekyll

=== 1053
im pretty sure i gotta github combine freedomtoons

=== 1434 josh came over, just left
combined dotfiles, projects, and misc => pushed to github

i want to do freedomtoons jekyll => 11ty

=== 1459 might have borked mSD

== 1506 didnt, just dusty

i might as well go thru all these files too right?

	so my files 
mSD
	pi
	pi^
	cyan
usb3 - samsung
ssd - franken
roy
xps
mac

homes
	pi0
	pi3b
	scarlett
	cyan

so

if i get FRANKEN working i can start doing data backup

once i get data backed up i can salvage roy

its so weird how once you start thinking about data, its all the same
so if you do inventory, might as well do it all

really should get this seamus shit up
