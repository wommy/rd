waddup doe

it works, finally

if theres a file thats less than 12 hours old
	append

hows that work in bash, idk

- bowl time -

so what am i doing?:
	looking over old writes

creates config.js
	looks for config.js, if not, creates

theres this array[] it gotta fills
	map()

functional
	.map

read folder
	maps to list
	writes list to echo
	populates first line

take a folder
	give it a name
	populate list with ^

fill a folder with 5 things
write a script that takes those five things
and puts them into a file

ls * > foo

join those things together

[1,2,3,4,5]

reducer?

skip this step come back later TODO

ok so

i got:
	[index, about, cats, dogs]

i want to:
	[i love index, i love about, i love cats, i love dogs]

run a function on it

to ARRAY, do(function)
	prepend: "i love "

prepend & append - to wrap template

later: checking for variables

#{content}

do this function[content, variables]
	to template

append " as a friend"
