hi yah - im getting this down

so i think the biggest problem ive had is that 
i keep designing new systems instead of sticking with one

acclimating myself with vim, bash, and other linux utilities satiates
instead of chasing the new, i need to instead go back to basics

stand on the shoulders of giants

the best was the original, tom preston-werner

simple workflow

1. create blogpost
2. write blogpost
3. edit / proof-read
4. publish

on publish -
publishes to a directory
write a command to run a SSG on folder

i gotta write the SSG too
but thats next/later

what does the, no THE, SSG do?
