### 1901
-
	rough draft final of seamus invoice 1

	summary
		seamus contracted me mid april 2019 to do a slurry of changes.
		this invoice bills
			removing the # from the url
			updating the ssl
			and the work that made that possible
	
	all dates are in year 2019

	work: 
		dates - summary
		4/29 
			created a donate page, uploaded it, established a redirect
		5/17
			dug into AWS, found that cloudfront was blocking the redirect
		5/31
			got a redirect to work with route53, AWS's routing service
			cloudfront still blocking proper url from working
		6/3
			researched and implemented http 301 in an override attempt, doesnt work
		6/25
			researched and found the proper angular code to remove the hash route
		7/26
			researched, learned, installed dependencies, and tested codecommit
		10/1
			implemented angular solution through codecommit and cloudfront
		10/7
			updated ssl certificate
		
	we dicussed $75 per feature,
	on my stack, i could have implemented a soltuion, 4/29's work, in one day
	from beginning to end, just shy of 6 months transpired
	i did my best to go back over communication from that period
		to create some type of timeline as to the time i spent and the changes i made
	the above dates and times only reflect a loose generalization of work done
		i left out at least three other dates which i dont have documentation on
	
	i surmised a bill of $350 on 10/15 detailing:
		$75 per feature
			removed # from url
			update ssl certificate
		$200 
			navigating AWS technologies: 
				s3, cloudfront, route53, codecommit, probably more i forgot
			and their intersection with angular

	i did this from the hip, trying to avoid tracking down specific dates/times
	looking back i spent AT LEAST six (6) days troubleshooting
	with slim to nil help from the past dev who set things up
	in hindsight this should be a minimum of $300 dollars, 
		but probably closer to $500, the price a consultant quoted

	i billed seamus $350 on 11/26, he paid $175 on 12/7

	all im asking is for this invoice's withstanding $175
	with the pledge to provide better documentation in the future
