-
	i need to push more
	i redid yesterdays work, today, in two branches
	i should have made a few pushes yesterday and rebased it today
	i still need to rebase this,
		first half is pretty good,
		second half, not so much
-
	i still need to compare across my wacky renamed folders
		this is what git was made for
